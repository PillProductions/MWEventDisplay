# MWEventDisplay

This project contains a very small web based "event screen". It allows you to configure an event with logo, event name, Wi-Fi credentials, optional text blocks and background images. After filling the form and pressing **Play**, the page switches to a fullscreen slideshow that cycles through each cue with fade/zoom effects.

Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build tools are required and everything works offline. Place your own images in the `defaults/` folder (e.g., `logo.png`, `bg-01.jpg`, `bg-02.jpg`).
